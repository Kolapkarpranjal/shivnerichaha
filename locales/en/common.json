    "brandStoryDesc": "Shivneri Tea...... The revered deity of undivided Maharashtra, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, established Hindavi Swarajya and created history. Maintaining that same self-respect, we named our business \"Shivneri Tea\". Any business must have energy, consistency, and restraint for it to be successful. Today, while running the \"Shivneri Tea\" business, we are very happy to say that we are moving towards success in a short time. Today, many people want to become successful by doing business, but they are confused about where to invest and what business to do. Overcoming a difficult situation like COVID, we entered this business and are running the tea business with the goal of making our mark. Our tea has a unique taste and is people's first choice. If anyone goes regularly from our shop, they will definitely come to \"Shivneri Tea\". The response of people in just 2 to 3 years is truly incredible. Quality flavored Shendri jaggery tea and a unique style of tea shops and a pleasant atmosphere are our features. We are always ready to serve our customers and make a hard effort to provide excellent service. \"Shivneri Tea\" outlets will open not only in entire Maharashtra but in entire India. At the same time, we are moving forward with the goal of reaching our Maharashtra's name through \"Shivneri Tea\". While starting our business, we have always tried to provide better service than other tea businesses and will definitely continue to do so in the future. With the aim of giving every customer a unique and personalized tea house experience, today Shivneri Tea is a prestigious brand.",
